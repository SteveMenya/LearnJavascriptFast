**Variables**
```
Variables are names given to data that we need to store and manipulate in our programs
All statements in Javascrips must end with a semi-colon

**Rules for creating variable**
A variable can only contain (a-z, A-B), numbers, underscores(_) or dollar signs($) however the first character cannot be a number

There are some reserved words that cannot be used as variable names.  Example var, if, while, class, return

Variable names are case sensitive. Meaning username and userName are two different variables

It is common practice to use camel case while naming variables. Example; thisIsMyVariable;
```

**numbers**- numerical valurs represented using digits and decimal points
**strings**- text. Must be enclosed in a single or double quotation marks

**if statement**
```
Most commonly used control flow statement
It allows the program to evaluate if a certain condition is met, and to perform appropriate actions based on the evaluation
```

**Jump Statement**
```
A jump statement is a statement used to instruct the program to deviate from its normal flow sequence and jump to another line of code

The Break statement is used to to exit a loop when a condition is met

Continue - anything after continue will not be read when a condition is met
